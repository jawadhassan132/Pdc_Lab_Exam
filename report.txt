Dataset: 94 images (4 classes: cars, Cat, dogs, Flowers)
Target Size: 128x128 pixels

BEST WORKER CONFIGURATION
================================================

Optimal Configuration: 4 workers

Reasoning:
The 4-worker configuration achieved the best performance with 1.82x speedup and completed processing in 0.38 seconds. While 8 workers were tested, they performed worse due to increased overhead from process creation and inter-process communication. With only 94 images in the dataset, the parallel overhead at 8 workers outweighed the benefits of additional parallelism. The 4-worker configuration strikes the optimal balance between parallelism and overhead for this workload size.

================================================
ANALYSIS: PARALLELISM AND BOTTLENECKS
================================================

Parallelism improved performance by distributing the image processing workload across multiple CPU cores, allowing simultaneous execution of resize and watermark operations. The sequential approach processed images one at a time, while parallel and distributed methods reduced total execution time by up to 1.82x. However, several bottlenecks remain. First, the relatively small dataset size (94 images) limits scalability gains, as the overhead of creating and coordinating multiple processes becomes significant compared to actual processing time. Second, I/O operations for reading and writing images are not fully parallelized and can create contention when multiple workers access the file system simultaneously. Third, the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) would affect CPU-bound operations if we used threading instead of multiprocessing, though this was avoided by using separate processes. Finally, memory overhead increases with more workers as each process maintains its own copy of the processing functions and data structures. For larger datasets, these bottlenecks would be less significant relative to computation time, and higher worker counts would show better efficiency.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
================================================

Libraries Used:
- Pillow (PIL): Image processing operations
- multiprocessing: Parallel and distributed processing
- time: Performance measurement

Key Features:
1. Sequential: Baseline single-threaded implementation
2. Parallel: multiprocessing.Pool for true multi-core parallelism
3. Distributed: Simulated 2-node distributed system using separate processes

All implementations maintain consistent output quality and folder structure.

CONCLUSION
================================================

The experiment successfully demonstrated performance improvements through parallelism. The 4-worker parallel configuration provided the best results for this dataset size. The distributed approach shows potential for scaling across multiple machines, though overhead is more noticeable on smaller datasets. Future work could test larger datasets to better demonstrate scalability and explore GPU-based processing for further acceleration.
